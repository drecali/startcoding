# Beginner Coding Resources
I often recommend the same links to people curious about coding or just starting out. Here's a more efficient way to share these links.

## The very beginning
Coding is just problem solving. It's a logic puzzle. You don't need to learn a coding language to do a logic puzzle.

### For Apple computers or iPads
* [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) is an excellent way to learn to code. It's an interactive game with nice instructions.

### For mobile
* [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app) is a game that incidentally teaches coding. I'm a big fan of it.

### Drag & Drop
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is the original drag & drop coding. It uses modular puzzle-shaped blocks to create animations and games.
* [Entry](https://playentry.org/) is a Korean version of Scratch. It has some easy to use AI features built-in! It uses modular puzzle-shaped blocks to create animations and games. 

### Play with AI
* [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is an easy way to train an AI without writing any code.

## More serious curriculum
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free open-source interactive coding curriculum broken up in tiny lessons. It's what I mostly used to learn coding from scratch. There are 1000+ groups worldwide meeting regularly to learn together and support each other. Check out the [directory](https://study-group-directory.freecodecamp.org/). Studying with others is a great way to build up a consistent habit and keep motivated. FCC can take you from zero knowledge to job-ready (for an entry level job where you'll learn even more).
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) is a popular app with small interactive lessons and good explanations.

## Inspiration & Beyond
* [Google AI Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) - great inspiration and exposure to AI.
* [AIY Projects from Google](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/) look cool but I'm not sure how to get the kits. You could probably buy the components individually, then use the tutorials to make fun projects. The projects themselves are good ideas for beginners.
