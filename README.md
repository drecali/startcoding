# Beginner Coding Resources
I often recommend the same links to people curious about coding or just starting out. As a self-taught dev that's now supporting others on their learning journey, these are resources I've either used or think very highly of. I hope they'll be helpful! This list is not meant to include **all** resources, because that can be overwhelming. Unless noted otherwise, I only included resources I used myself and often recommend to others, or were highly recommended to me. If there's something I missed, please let me know.

## The very beginning - find out if you like it
Coding is just problem solving. It's a logic puzzle. You don't need to learn a coding language to do a logic puzzle.

### For Apple computers or iPads
* [Swift Playgrounds](https://www.apple.com/swift/playgrounds/) is an excellent way to learn to code. It's an interactive game with nice instructions.

### For mobile
* [Grasshopper](https://grasshopper.app) is a game that incidentally teaches coding. I'm a big fan of it.

### Drag & Drop
* [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is the original drag & drop coding. It uses modular puzzle-shaped blocks to create animations and games.
* [Entry](https://playentry.org/) is a Korean version of Scratch. It has some easy to use AI features built-in! It uses modular puzzle-shaped blocks to create animations and games. 

### Play with AI
* [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is an easy way to train an AI without writing any code.

## A curriculum to follow
* [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) is a free open-source interactive coding curriculum broken up in tiny lessons. It's what I mostly used to learn coding from scratch. There are 1000+ groups worldwide meeting regularly to learn together and support each other. Check out the [directory](https://study-group-directory.freecodecamp.org/). Studying with others is a great way to build up a consistent habit and keep motivated. FCC can take you from zero knowledge to job-ready (for an entry level job where you'll learn even more).
* [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com) is a popular app with small interactive lessons and good explanations.
* ðŸ’¥ [Scrimba](https://scrimba.com) is the future of coding education. The lessons look like screen recordings of a text editor, but it's not video. It's an actual text editor with actual editable text. You can pause the lesson and modify the actual code on your screen and get instant feedback, then resume the lesson. It's magic! There is free content and a subscription. I don't usually sign up for subscriptions, but I gladly signed up for Scrimba. It's great value. Their free [React course](https://drecali.link/reactscrimba) is excellent and really helped me understand React.
* [Sabe](https://sabe.io/classes) it's free and has a lot of useful beginner content but I haven't used it myself.

## Useful tools
* [Javascript Visualized](https://pythontutor.com/render.html#code=%0Afor%20%28let%20i%3D0%3Bi%3C5%3Bi%2B%2B%29%20%7B%0A%20%20console.log%28%0A%20%20%60Here%20is%20a%20simple%20loop%20visualized.%0A%20%20This%20is%20iteration%20%23%24%7Bi%20%2B%201%7D.%0A%20%20Currently,%20i%3D%24%7Bi%7D%5Cn%60%29%20%20%0A%7D&cumulative=false&curInstr=17&heapPrimitives=nevernest&mode=display&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=js&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false) - Works with many other programming languages. Paste in valid code and see what's going on under the hood, line by line.

## ðŸ¤¯ A Free Bootcamp! How is this possible? ðŸ¤¯
* [100 Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) - Free remote coding bootcamp taught by a really nice guy that wants to help others access quality code education for free. The community is very nice too.

## Inspiration & Beyond
* [Google AI Experiments](https://experiments.withgoogle.com/collection/ai) - great inspiration and exposure to AI.
* [AIY Projects from Google](https://aiyprojects.withgoogle.com/vision/) look cool but I'm not sure how to get the kits. You could probably buy the components individually, then use the tutorials to make fun projects. The projects themselves are good ideas for beginners.
